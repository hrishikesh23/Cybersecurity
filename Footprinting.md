Phase 1 - Footprinting

Footprinting Ways:
-> Use Search Engines and Google Hacking Technique
-> Web Services and Social Networking Sites
-> Web Footpriniting and Email Footprinting
-> Whois, DNS and Network Footprinting
-> Social Engineering

Gaining Information Passively or Actively about the target.

Gather Information about:
Organization
Network
System

The Information gathered during this phase shall include following:
IP Address Range
Namespaces
Employee Information
Phone Number
Facility Information 
Job Information

Also information that is carelessly exposed.

If Information collection is not done carefully it could lead to:
Time Waste
Attack to fail
Attractting target's attention

Smart attacker will spend a good amount of time in this phase

Steps of Ethical Hacking:
1. Footprinting
2. Scanning
3. Enumeration
4. System Hacking

Ensure Proper information retreival:
1. Collect information that is publicly available. i.e Host and Network Information
2. Ascertain the OS in Use in the environment, Including web Server and web application data where possible
3. Issue queries such as WHOIS , DNS , network and organizational.
4. Locate existing or potential vulnerabilities

Footprinting Objective:
Knowledge of Security Posture
Reduction on focus Area
Identifying Vulnerabilities
Drawing of network map

Passive Fooprinting:
Using Search Engines
Location Information
People Search
Financial Information
Infrastructure details
Web Footprinting
OS Information
Social Engineering
Website Traffic Monitoring

Active Footprinting:
Query Published name servers
Serach Files
Whois
DNS
Trceroute

WHOIS:
Registrar Information
Location Information
Name Servers
Email

DNS:
A - Points to a Host's IP Address
MX - Mail Server
NS - Point to Host Name Server
CNAME - Cannonical Naming
SOA - Start Of Authority
SRV - Service Record
PTR - Maps IP address to Hostname
RP - Responsible Person
HINFO - Host Information record includes CPU Type and OS


A and QUAD AAAA records:
A record are used for IPV4
AAAA record are used for IPV6

Alias or CNAME 
Alternative Record

Mail Exchange 


Service Record
Location of Service on the network
Target Port
Priority

Start Of Authority
One Per Zone
Primary Nmae server
DNS server with Most authority with DNS record
Email of Administrator
Serial Number
Refresh time for Zone

Name Server
Can be DNS server ith secondary zones
Best source to answer queries
- No cahced data

PTR 
Mapping between IP Address to Name Mapping
Reverse Lookup

DNS Namespace:
Fully qualified domain name
Namespace needs to be divided

Root Domain  ( . Dot )- Over 300 root servers
Top Level Domain - .com ,net .org
Second Level Domains - Amazon , Flipkart
Third Level - Fourth Level - www. FTP
